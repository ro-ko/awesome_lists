# Awesome Lists for Tenure-Track Asst. Professors and PhD students 

[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)
## Introduction

As an incoming Tenure-Track Assistant Professor (TTAP) and a recently graduated CS PhD (as of 09/2022), I believe I am in a good position to start collecting useful resources (awesome lists) for TTAPs and PhD students. From my perspective, I hope these lists can contribute to your, and my success (for TTAP, success is defined as getting a tenured position in six years; for PhD students, success is defined as happily graduated, eventually). These lists include stuff like GPU cost-compute trade-offs, funding resources, etc., which I believe would be important for TTAPs aside from the research we do. I hope I can continue to refine these lists throughout my time as a TTAP, and I truly welcome any contributions from the community. Please submit pull requests if you feel like adding stuff to the lists.

Disclaimer: I'm primarily focusing on computer vision and resources in mainland, China. However, the content of the lists should be applicable to most CS fields. I hope we can expand the scope of these lists in the future. Please pardon my bilingual writing.


## Contents

1. Funding / Grant Resources

    In this list I am looking at funding/grant from both the government and companies, as well as fellowships/scholarships available for PhD students.

    See [funding.md](./funding.md).

2. Social Media / Academic Profiles (for both TTAPs and PhD students)

    We may need some kind of paper filtering as there are too many papers published everyday. Also, it's important to have a platform to promote and discuss one's work other than at top conferences. In this list I aim to collect all kinds of social media sites where we could build our academic profiles.


    See [social.md](./social.md).

3. Computational Resources

    In this list I have collected and compared major cloud GPU vendors and full machine cost in order to strategize the best use of our fund. This should be updated on a year-to-year basis as GPU prices are volatile.

    See [computing.md](./computing.md).


4. Conferences

    In this list, yearly timelines for paper submissions and workshop/tutorial proposals are collected so we could
    better plan out our work schedule.


    See [conferences.md](./conferences.md).

5. Workshops and Competitions (for both TTAPs and PhD students)

    In this list, I aim to list relevant workshops and competitions (as these would be an efficient way to boost name recognition for the lab and TTAPs, aside from publishing at top conferences) in my field. Feel free to add more areas by submitting a pull request.

    See [competitions.md](./competitions.md).

    How to propose and host a workshop? To be added.

6. How to Run A Lab / Recruit Candidates

    In this list, I try to gather useful recruitment info from top labs and bits and pieces on how they are managed. Some important questions for young TTAPs include whether and how to have weekly meetings, reports, etc.

    See [managing.md](./managing.md).
    

7. General Advice from Others (for both TTAPs and PhD students)

    This lists useful advice from other senior professors/researchers.

    See [advice.md](./advice.md).

8. Awesome Academic Pages (for both TTAPs and PhD students)

    I believe in openness and transparency. I think an informative academic page is important for both TTAPs and PhD students. A well-organized lab web page could lead to more collaboration. In this list I gather some of the best pages IMO.
    
    See [webpage.md](./webpage.md).

    
9. Awesome Courses (for both TTAPs and PhD students)

    An important part of being a professor is teaching. Here I collect a list of famous courses and share some personal thoughts on how they are technically managed.
    

    See [courses.md](./courses.md).

10. Awesome Research Lists (for both TTAPs and PhD students)

    Good awesome lists for specific fields.

    See [research_lists.md](./research_lists.md).

11. Tricks and hacks that I think would be useful.

    + [How to monitor utilization of multiple GPU nodes](./junwei_notes/note_nv_monitoring.md).

    + [Technical notes on making websites for personal/projects/courses](https://github.com/JunweiLiang/junweiliang.github.io/blob/master/note.md).

    + [How to make home machines SSH-able from anywhere](./junwei_notes/server_ssh_anywhere.md).

    + [How To Make Web-Accessible Demos For Your AI Research/Applications](./junwei_notes/web_app_tech_notes.md).
