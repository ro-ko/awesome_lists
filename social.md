### Paper Digest

Since there are too many papers published everyday, we may need some preliminary paper filtering before actually reading them.
Aside from looking at papers already published at top conferences, we could follow some social media sites that I think are providing good recommendations.

Here are some public accounts or social media worth paying attention to. The articles recommended above are basically worth reading.

### Academic Platform

It's important to have a platform to promote and discuss one's work other than at top conferences. In this list I aim to collect all kinds of social media sites where we could build our academic profiles.

Junwei: Having 1-3 profiles would be enough. I have way too many.

Establish academic files/self-media accounts to facilitate recommendation and discussion of your own research work
