### Recruitment

In this list, I try to gather useful recruitment info from top labs and bits and pieces on how they are managed. Some important questions for young TTAPs include whether and how to have weekly meetings, reports, etc.

Here I list some other peopleâ€™s experiences on how to recruit students and how to manage laboratories.
