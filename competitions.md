## Workshops and Competitions (for both TTAPs and PhD students)

In this list, I aim to list relevant workshops and competitions (as these would be an efficient way to boost name recognition for the lab and TTAPs, aside from publishing at top conferences) in my field. Feel free to add more areas by submitting a pull request.

As a young professor, achieving good results in top competitions is a way to quickly increase your reputation. Related competitions are listed here by field.
